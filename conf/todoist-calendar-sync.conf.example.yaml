    # The rules are pretty rudimentary.
    # They only support labels currently

    # Examples:
    # foo # would match any items that have the label `foo`
    # foo AND bar # would match any items that have the label `foo` and the label `bar`
    # NOT foo AND bar # would match any items that have label `bar` and don't have the label `foo`
    # to get "OR" semantics, simply add additional rules referencing the same `calendarName`
